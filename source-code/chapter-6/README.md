### README

This exercise contains the source code for the first exercise of chapter 6. In the previous chapter exercises, we wrote a Dockerfile for this project and built the container. We then used Docker Volumes to persist the database across containers. In this exercise, you will modify the project so that the data, instead of saving to a SQLite database, persists to a MySQL database.

You will then create a custom bridge network to connect the project container and the MySQL container.
