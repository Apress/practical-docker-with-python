# themnewsbot

Telegram bot which fetches Bot posts top submissions from a subreddit. NewsBot is used to demo a short, simple Python project in my book, [Practical Docker With Python](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484237830). 

Refer to the [book repo](https://github.com/apress/practical-docker-with-python) for other exercises using this code.

### Getting started 

Install the requirements with pip

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Start the bot 

    NBT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token> python newsbot.py

where `<token>` is the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) token
