### README

This exercise contains the source code for the second exercise of chapter 7. In the previous chapterâ€™s exercises, we wrote a Dockerfile for our project. Later, we added volumes and the data was persisted to SQLite. In this exercise, we change the project to use MySQL instead of SQLite.

For this exercise, we will be working on a slightly modified codebase, which has support for saving the preferences to a SQLite DB. We would use Docker Volumes to persist the database across containers.
